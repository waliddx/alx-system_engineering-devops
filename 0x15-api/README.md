# Employee TODO List Progress Checker

## Overview

This Python script interacts with a REST API to retrieve information about an employee's progress on their TODO list. It takes an employee ID as input and fetches the employee's name along with their TODO list items. It then calculates and displays the number of completed tasks out of the total tasks for that employee.

The script is designed to work with the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which provides mock data for testing and prototyping.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
